/*
 * Design a class ArrOperation which should support following methods.
 *  Assume each method will receive an array of positive integers.
 *  
 *  
 *  1.   Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the input array.
Mirror section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example
maxMirror([1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1]) → 3
maxMirror([7, 1, 4, 9, 7, 4, 1]) → 2
maxMirror([1, 2, 1, 4]) → 3
maxMirror*([1, 4, 5, 3, 5, 4, 1]) → 7
Throw assertion error in case array is empty.
2.   Return the number of clumps in the input array.
	Clump in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. For example
	
	countClumps([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 2, 1, 1]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) → 1
Throw assertion error in case array is empty.
3.  Solve fixXY problem
Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the input array, but rearranged so that every X is immediately followed by a Y. Do not move X within array, but every other number may move. For ex: 
Let’s say value of X is 4 and Y is 5. Then 
	
	fixXY([5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]) → [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]
fixXY([1, 4, 1, 5]) → [1, 4, 5, 1]
fixXY([1, 4, 1, 5, 5, 4, 1]) → [1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5]
Assume we are receiving an array of integers along with value of X and Y as a method parameter.
Throw assertion in following cases : 
If array is empty
If there are unequal numbers of X and Y in input array.
If two adjacent X values are there.
If X occurs at the last index of array.
4.   splitArray
Return the index if there is a place to split the input array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side else return -1. For ex
splitArray([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → 3
splitArray([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → -1
splitArray([10, 10]) → 1
Throw assertion error in case array is empty.
